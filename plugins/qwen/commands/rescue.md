description: Delegate investigation, an explicit fix request, or follow-up rescue work to the Qwen rescue subagent
argument-hint: "[--background|--wait] [--resume|--fresh] [--model <model|alias>] [--effort <none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh>] [--include-dirs <path>[,<path>...]] [what Qwen should investigate, solve, or continue]"
context: fork
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), AskUserQuestion
---

Flags:

- `--include-dirs <path>[,<path>...]` — expand Qwen's write sandbox beyond `cwd`. Required if you ask Qwen to write files outside the current workspace. Without this, Qwen silently redirects writes to `~/.qwen/tmp/<workspace>/`. May be comma-separated or repeated.

Example:

```
/qwen:rescue --include-dirs /tmp,/Users/me/output draft a research doc at /tmp/research.md
```


Route this request to the `qwen:qwen-rescue` subagent.
The final user-visible response must be Qwen's output verbatim.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the `qwen:qwen-rescue` subagent in the background.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the `qwen:qwen-rescue` subagent in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Do not forward them to `task`, and do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the forwarded `task` call, but do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- If the request includes `--resume`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- If the request includes `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Qwen, check for a resumable rescue thread from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/qwen-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Qwen thread or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Qwen thread`
  - `Start a new Qwen thread`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Qwen thread (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Qwen thread (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before routing to the subagent.
- If the user chooses a new thread, add `--fresh` before routing to the subagent.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally.

Operating rules:

- The subagent is a thin forwarder only. It should use one `Bash` call to invoke `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/qwen-companion.mjs" task ...` and return that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the Qwen companion stdout verbatim to the user.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not ask the subagent to inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/qwen:status`, fetch `/qwen:result`, call `/qwen:cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a specific reasoning effort.
- Leave the model unset unless the user explicitly asks for one. Aliases: `plus`, `max`, `turbo`, `coder`, `glm`, `kimi`.
- Leave `--resume` and `--fresh` in the forwarded request. The subagent handles that routing when it builds the `task` command.
- If the helper reports that Qwen is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/qwen:setup`.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what Qwen should investigate or fix.
